# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python Introduction

This repository allows you to run Jupyterlab without any installation directly in your browser. This allows you to discover basics of notebooks and Python "out-of-the-box". For the next stage of the course, please visit the main [DAVPy repo](https://github.com/guiwitz/DAVPy).

## Interactive session

There are two ways to run the notebooks. 

First you can use this link: https://guiwitz.github.io/DAVPy_intro. It uses a new approach to run notebooks directly in the browser. This solution is still in early stages and might be unstable e.g. regarding access to data.

Second, you can use the binder badge at the top of this file to open an classic Jupyter session on the binder service. Note that here your changes are not saved between sessions: as soon as you close the page or leave the session unused for more than 10min, it closes and is erased.
