# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python Introduction

This repository allows you to run Jupyterlab without any installation directly in your browser. This allows you to discover basics of notebooks and Python "out-of-the-box". For the next stage of the course, please visit the main [DAVPy repo](https://github.com/guiwitz/DAVPy).

## Interactive session

There are three ways to run the notebooks. 

- First you can use this link: https://guiwitz.github.io/DAVPy_intro. It uses a new approach to run notebooks directly in the browser. This will allow you to explore the JupyterLab interface, open, create and run notebooks. However this solution is still in early stages and might be unstable (execution might sometimes hang or there mgith be trouble accessing to data.

- Second, you can use the binder badge at the top of this file to open a fully functional Jupyter session on the [binder](https://mybinder.org/) service. Your session might take from a few seconds to a few minutes to start. Note that here your changes are not saved between sessions: as soon as you close the page or leave the session unused for more than 10 min, it closes and is erased.

- Third, you can use the Renku badge at the top of this file to open a fully functional Jupyter session on the [renku](https://renkulab.io/) service offered by the Swiss Data Science Center. Here again, your session migth take up to a few minutes to open, so be patient. Just like for the binder solution, your session is temporary. **If you want to keep your changes**, you have to:
    - login to the service using either your GitHub account or your eduID account
    - go to the [project page](https://renkulab.io/projects/guiwitz/davpy-intro) and make your own "copy" using the fork button
    - now you can use the start button to create a session. Note that the first time, this might take up to 10-15 min until your project is properly built
